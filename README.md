# InterpretedUserType

Decided to create this repository to keep track, in an open source and collaborative way, of the different InterpretedUserType values and meanings.

Original blog post was developed and is maintained by [@dariomws](https://github.com/dariomws) and me here https://get-itips.capazero.net/posts/sfbonprem-interpretedusertype and dates back to 5th of May, 2019.

We feel that, as the list of Interpreted User Types is growing, based on blog post feedback, the blog post by itself can't keep with it and it is a great opportunity for other SfB/Teams architects to contribute here.

## How to contribute

Repository has two branches, main and dev, and every pull request against the documentation found here must be done against the dev branch.

Many thanks for your contributions.
